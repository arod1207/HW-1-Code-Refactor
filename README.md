# HW #1 Code Refactor

### I added some alt tags to some images that were missing to help some browsers that can't load images. 

### Added a title tag to make it more of a professional looking site. Condensed some of the css tags and deleted some unused ID selectors.

### Added semantic tags

* header
* nav 
* main
* section
* aside
* footer
